    "## Chemical kinetics\n",
    "In chemistry one is often interested in how fast a chemical process proceeds. Chemical reactions (when viewed as single events on a molecular scale) are probabilitic. However, most reactive systems of interest involve very large numbers of molecules (a few grams of a simple substance containts on the order of $10^{23}$ molecules. The sheer number allows us to describe this inherently stochastic process deterministically.\n",

    "### Law of mass action\n",
    "In order to describe chemical reactions as as system of ODEs in terms of concentrations ($c_i$) and time ($t$), one can use the [law of mass action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_mass_action):\n",
